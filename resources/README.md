**Suggested progression:**

1. Start with the **Official Python Tutorial** to build a strong foundation.  
2. Use *Automate the Boring Stuff* or *Python Crash Course* for practical projects.  
3. Explore the **Python HOWTOs** for specific topics (e.g. file handling, regex).  
4. Reference the **Library Reference** and **PyPI** when you need extra functionality.  
5. Use *Think Python* and *Whirlwind Tour of Python* to deepen your Python fluency.  
6. Reinforce skills with Real Python exercises and examples.

## How to Use This Directory

- **Track your path.** Start with Python basics → move into modeling once comfortable.  
- **Hands-on tie-ins.** After each reading, try to implement simple models (logistic map, predator–prey, small networks, cellular automata).  
- **Link to math references.** Use “Mathematical Background” when you hit unfamiliar math.  
- **Visualize.** Use gallery code as templates for your own projects.  
- **Expand.** Add new links, tutorials, and papers as you go.
