## Reading Tracks & Suggested Materials

### Python for Beginners

These resources are good for getting comfortable with Python — syntax, data structures, functions, basic libraries — before diving into modeling.

| Title | Description / Why it’s useful | Format / Access |
|---|---|---|
| **Official Python Tutorial** | The core introduction to the language | [docs.python.org/3/tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/) |
| **Python HOWTOs** | Practical mini-guides on common topics (regex, argparse, unicode, etc.) | [docs.python.org/3/howto](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/) |
| **Python Library Reference** | Documentation of the full standard library | [docs.python.org/3/library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/) |
| **Python Package Index (PyPI)** | Repository of third-party packages | [pypi.org](https://pypi.org) |
| *Automate the Boring Stuff with Python* by Al Sweigart | Very accessible, hands-on tasks | Free online / book |
| *Python Crash Course* by Eric Matthes | A structured beginner course with projects | Book / eBook |
| *Think Python* by Allen B. Downey | Introduction to programming using Python | [greenteapress.com/thinkpython2](https://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/html/index.html) |
| *A Whirlwind Tour of Python* by Gaël Varoquaux | Compact, fast-paced intro to Python essentials | [jakevdp.github.io/WhirlwindTourOfPython](https://jakevdp.github.io/WhirlwindTourOfPython/) |
| Real Python (website) | Tutorials, articles, deep dives | [realpython.com](https://realpython.com/) |
| W3Schools Python Tutorial | Quick reference & interactive examples | [w3schools.com/python](https://www.w3schools.com/python/) |

**Suggested progression:**

1. Start with the **Official Python Tutorial** to build a strong foundation.  
2. Use *Automate the Boring Stuff* or *Python Crash Course* for practical projects.  
3. Explore the **Python HOWTOs** for specific topics (e.g. file handling, regex).  
4. Reference the **Library Reference** and **PyPI** when you need extra functionality.  
5. Use *Think Python* and *Whirlwind Tour of Python* to deepen your Python fluency.  
6. Reinforce skills with Real Python exercises and examples.

## How to Use This Directory

- **Track your path.** Start with Python basics → move into modeling once comfortable.  
- **Hands-on tie-ins.** After each reading, try to implement simple models (logistic map, predator–prey, small networks, cellular automata).  
- **Link to math references.** Use “Mathematical Background” when you hit unfamiliar math.  
- **Visualize.** Use gallery code as templates for your own projects.  
- **Expand.** Add new links, tutorials, and papers as you go.
