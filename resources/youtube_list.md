## 3. Additional Resources

### [Modeling Dynamic Systems with Python (Playlist)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQVvvaa0QuDc2kBzJbS4xKx0L5Xo6tI44)
**Channel:** sentdex  
**Focus:** Introduction to numerical modeling and visualization of dynamic systems in Python.  
**Relevance:** Offers step-by-step development of ODE solvers, useful for extending the tutorial to more complex models.

---

### [Simulating Differential Equations in Python – Complete Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEJNB2zjpvw)
**Channel:** NeuralNine  
**Focus:** Using `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp` for stable and efficient ODE integration.  
**Relevance:** Good reference for students who wish to go beyond the Euler method used in the examples.

**Suggested use:**
1. Watch the logistic growth and predator–prey examples before or after completing the coding tasks.  
2. Compare your simulation results and figures with those in the videos.  
3. For parameter studies, refer to the bifurcation and phase-space tutorials to guide visualization choices.
