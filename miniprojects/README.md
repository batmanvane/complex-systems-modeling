# Mini-Projects

This directory contains the larger applied modeling projects for the course.  
Each project builds on the concepts and tools introduced in the earlier tutorials (e.g., *Building Your Own Model*) and encourages students to design, implement, and analyze complex systems independently.

## Projects Overview
1. **Building Your Own Model** - Foundational exercise on one- and two-dimensional dynamical systems (logistic growth, predator-prey) located in `01BuildingYourOwnModel/`.

## Structure
Each project folder typically includes:
- **project_description.md** - Explanation of objectives, theory, and detailed task list  
- **project_details.pdf** - Detailed Explanation of objectives, theory, and detailed task list  
- **Starter notebook (.ipynb)** - Template with initial code structure  
- **Sample data (if applicable)** - Input files or parameter sets for testing  
- **Reference solution (for instructors)** - Not distributed to students  (later)

## Additional Resources
Supplementary material for the *Building Your Own Model* project, including curated video tutorials on logistic and predator-prey models, is available in  
[`resources/youtube_tutorials.md`](../../resources/youtube_tutorials.md).
