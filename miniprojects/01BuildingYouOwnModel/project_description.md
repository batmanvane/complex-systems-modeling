# Project Folder: 01 – Building Your Own Model

This folder contains all materials for the modeling tutorial **"Building Your Own Model"**.  
It guides you step by step from a simple one-dimensional system (logistic growth) to a two-dimensional predator–prey model.

## Contents
- **tutorial_modeling.tex** – Main tutorial document outlining the tasks, theoretical background, and Python code examples for simulating and analyzing both systems.  
- **Colab templates** – Example notebooks used in class for implementing the Euler and Runge–Kutta methods.  
- **Example code and figures** – Supporting files for numerical experiments and visualization.  

## Objective
Students will:
1. Develop their own simulation models starting from verbal problem descriptions.  
2. Implement numerical integration and visualization in Python or Google Colab.  
3. Explore and interpret how parameter changes affect model behavior.  
4. Optionally, perform stability and phase-space analyses.
